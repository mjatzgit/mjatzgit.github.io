The solution was a 'one pager', divided in sections, and with modals (popups) to contain additional content. <br> Reconstructing the carefully crafted Design in the browser, especiallly regarding fonts and letter spacing, was somehow a challenge to perfectionize due to our glorious cross browser world, but in the end the result was really satisfying. It's also possible to order a table in the bar at a specific time and date. To feature that, a Wordpress plugin called Restaurant Reservation was customised to suit the requirements by Lidkoeb. The Instagram Api was also used to display the latest images uploaded to their profile.",

To meet these requirements some jQuery was used to determine screen height and width, and to calculate the image size, which all have diffenrent aspect ratio. Not an easy task also considering the cross browser universe. but check it out, the result was quite good :-). <br> Wordpress was choosen to give Kelly an easy way to create and update galleries.",
